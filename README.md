# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model utilizing the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset. The objective is to forecast the hourly demand for rental bikes, considering the bike count and a wide range of environmental variables recorded from December 2017 to November 2018. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model will provide reliable estimates for the number of rental bikes required per hour. The ultimate goal is to enable effective resource management and allocation, improving the efficiency of bike-sharing services. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical data, the project seeks to enhance planning and decision-making processes for bike rental businesses.

## Steps Involved

Data Exploring: Explored the dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure and variables.

Data Wrangling: Performed data wrangling to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and analyze patterns, distributions, and correlations in the data.

Hypothesis Testing: Utilized hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and evaluate relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering & Data Pre-processing: Engaged in feature engineering and data pre-processing to create new features and transform variables for better model performance.

ML Model Implementation: Implemented machine learning models to train and evaluate predictive algorithms for forecasting the count of rental bikes.

Results: The implemented models and analyses provide insights into the factors influencing bike rental demand and offer predictions for future bike rental requirements.

## Conclusion:
The project successfully developed a predictive model for hourly bike rental demand, enabling better resource management and operational efficiency for bike-sharing services. Future work could involve exploring additional features, improving model accuracy, and integrating real-time data for dynamic prediction updates.
